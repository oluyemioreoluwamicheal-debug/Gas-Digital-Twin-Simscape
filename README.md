# Liquid Flow Digital Twin – MATLAB Simscape

This project is a **Digital Twin prototype** built in **MATLAB Simscape (Thermal Liquid domain)**.  
It focuses on simulating the **liquid-side dynamics** of a tank–valve–reservoir system, measuring flow rates and pressure changes in response to valve control.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The model represents:
- **Liquid Tank** – stores and supplies fluid  
- **Control Valve (Poppet)** – regulates the flow rate  
- **Reservoirs** – simulate inflow and outflow conditions  

The simulation tracks **flow rate, pressure response, and system stability** over time, forming the foundation for more complex Digital Twin applications.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Built using **Simscape Thermal Liquid blocks**  
- Simulates **flow rate control** through a valve  
- Scope output showing **system stabilization at steady state**  
- Flexible: can be extended to include **gas phase, compressors, or multiphase separation**

## 📈 Benefits & Impact
- Provides insight into **liquid flow behavior** under valve control  
- Trains engineers in **digital twin concepts** for petroleum engineering  
- Can be scaled to represent **oil, water, or condensate flow in pipelines**  
- Lays the groundwork for full **oil & gas digital twin systems**
