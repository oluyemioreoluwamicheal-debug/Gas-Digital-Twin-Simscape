# Gas Digital Twin – MATLAB Simscape

This project is a **Digital Twin model of a gas system** built in **MATLAB Simscape**.  
It simulates the **flow and pressure dynamics** across a tank–valve–reservoir network, enabling better insight into gas transportation and optimization.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The model represents:
- **Gas Tank** – storage and supply source  
- **Control Valve** – regulating flow and pressure  
- **Reservoir** – receiving and balancing system  

By adjusting valve parameters and tank pressure, the digital twin mirrors how real-world systems behave under different conditions.
